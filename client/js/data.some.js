Stats recorded include time, distance, speed, pace, calories and altitude. Each session also has weight and notes fields.  Stats can be displayed in US or Metric units.  Speed, altitude and your GPS route can be viewed in easy to read graphs and all past sessions are saved in a database for later review.  Session types of Jogging, Walking, Hiking and Biking can be selected and you can share your stats via Twitter. GPX data can be emailed to yourself for upload to popular mapping sites.  Sessions can also be paused and resumed without changing your stats.  **New in this version: The ability to highlight a stat, auto-resizing screens to support the Pixi, and added Average Pace to the stats list. Note: A clear sky view (for good GPS accuracy) is required to use JogStats.",
