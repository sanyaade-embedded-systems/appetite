As the tiles are selected the number of mines that are adjacent to that tile is revealed to help the player determine the mines' locations. The game allows you to change board size and the number of mines in the field for varying difficulty and endless fun. Records are kept so you can keep track of your best times.\000a\000a-- If you had the beta version you must uninstall that prior to downloading.",

This Twitter account collects reports from riders who observe delays, accidents, and other events along the route.  FMCaltrain keeps its display up to date by using webOS alarms to periodically refresh the display of the next two trains and get the latest Twitter status.

"description": "Blocks is a classic and addictive puzzle game. The goal of the game is to slide the light-colored block off the board. To do this you must first slide the other blocks out of its way. This can be very tricky, but don't worry, the first puzzles are easy and will get you going quickly. Blocks remembers how far you have got, so you can pick it up and play at any time.\000a\000aThe blocks only slide along their oriented direction. So the horizontal blocks can only move left and right, while the vertical blocks slide up and down.\000a \000aOnce you complete all the puzzles in a difficulty level, the next level will be unlocked. There are four levels, easy, medium, hard and expert, each containing 25 puzzles for a total of 100 puzzles. You might fly through the first puzzles, but you'll be sweating over the later ones!\000a \000aWe hope you have fun playing the game. We're keen to hear what you think of it, so don't hesitate to write us with feedback, questions, or bugs (although we hope there aren't any!).",

"description": "Calql8 Tips is an easy to use Tip Calculator that is designed to be the quickest way to calculate tips on the Palm Pre & Pixi.  You can quickly enter the check and tax amount with the touch-screen keypad or the keyboard.  Unlike other tip calculators, the tax can be entered either as a percent or a dollar amount for times when you are traveling and do not know the tax rate for your current location.  The tax rate can be entered up to three decimal places (7.125% for example) to account for all taxable municipalities and the amount is entered by you instead of having to choose from pre-defined values that might not work for your area.  To save you time, the percentage to tip is selected by sliding your finger to quickly adjust the desired tip percentage, with all amounts being updated and displayed as you are making your adjustments.  You can choose to round the total or keep it to an exact amount and you can split the check with up to 10 people.  Your settings are saved so that subsequent uses only require you to enter a new check amount and adjust your tip percentage based on the quality of service.",

"description": "* This update provides more sensor size choices and will also allow you to select DSLR cameras by name or directly select the Circle of Confusion that is used in the DOF calculation.*\000a\000a\000aA depth of field calculator can help photographers to figure out how much of their picture will be in focus.  Depth of Field is a measure of how far in front or behind the focus point an object can be and still be in focus in an image. Depth of Field is determined by camera sensor size, lens focal length, lens aperture and subject distance. If the focus distance is set to the hyperfocal distance, the image will have the largest depth of field possible for that sensor, focal length and aperture.  For example a landscape photographer may want to have the entire scene in focus, so they would choose to focus at the hyperfocal distance so that everything from the close foreground to the distant horizon would appear sharp in the final image.  On the other hand a portrait photographer may want to use a very shallow depth of field so that distracting elements in the background will be blurred out of focus and not detract attention from the subject of the portrait.",

"description": "****************************\000aUpdated to fix hook movement issue. We worked with a user to find the problem and fix it thanks Derek. Also added a hook fish button to make getting fish easier but for the ultimate challenge catch them without the button.\000a****************************\000a****************************\000aPosition your hook near the fish and when they nibble on the line set the hook and catch the fish.\000aMove the hook around to catch this fish by tilting the phone. When a fish is nibbling on the line (phone vibrates) pull up to set the hook and catch the fish. Play in free play mode(not time limit) for just fun or try and make a new records in the timed mode.  **************\000aIn this release: removed the bullseye (screen automatically stays on), new movement calibration and controls, animated fish.",

The Freeplay has 13 different high pitch sounds (frequently called \"mosquito tones\" or \"mosquito ringtones\") that can be used to annoy almost anyone.  The Hearing Test will guide you through a wizard and give you your results of how high you can hear.  These high pitch sounds are often used by teenagers as cell phone ringtones because teachers and other adults cannot hear them.\000a\000a**NOTE: Palm does not currently allow setting the tones as your ringtone from the app. They are available for download from the support website for now and can be added as your ringtone manually. Adding them as ringtones will hopefully come in a later update.**",

"title": "Pegger Meister",
"description": "Pegger Meister is an addictive game perfect for anyone with a little time to burn while waiting for a meeting, a dental appointment, at the bus stop or subway terminal or at work when the boss is away.  The object of the game is to move the peg over an adjacent peg in order to remove it.  In order to jump over a peg, the hole on the other side must be vacant.  If you do it right and learn all the tricks with experience, you can win when only one peg is left on the board.\000a\000aThe way to win is to first get rid of all the pegs in the corners.  By leaving most of the pegs clumped together in the center until the end, you will probably have a greater chance of winning.  The lower the score is at the end, the better.  Low scorers are recorded in the records list.\000a\000aThere are several levels of difficulty which can be chosen from the preferences menu.  \000a\000aFor those of you who are interested in history, the game was most probably invented in France in the late 17th century.  \000a\000aNow start playing the game before the boss returns!",

With twoCalc you get to see your calculation as you enter it and edit it if you make a mistake.  TwoCalc stresses a clean, usable interface for the types of calculations you do most often.  Large color-coded keys are easy to use.  TwoCalc can be personalized: change the color of the keys, the background, and the (optional) audible feedback.  When run on smaller screens (such as the Pixi), keys dynamically resize to fit the screen.  Each calculation and result is recorded to the calculator “tape”, which can then be emailed.  TwoCalc stores up to 10 numbers or calculations in permanent memory.  You can rapidly recall from the first 6 memory slots with a single key press.  The special function key allows access to more advanced functions when you need them, including square root, basic trigonometry, percentages, and even metric to imperial conversions.  For programmers, twoCalc converts between number bases and optionally displays negative numbers in two's complement form with a user-specified word size.  If two dollars is too much for you, look for twoCalcFree in the app catalog.",

"title": "SudokuPlus Demo",
"description": "This is a free demo version of SudokuPlus. SudokuPlus is a “must have” game for your phone. It is the pr?mier version of the popular Sudoku game designed specifically for the Palm Pr? and Pixi. SudokuPlus is being introduced at just $2.99 (regular $4.99) until the end of the year. Sudoku is not only a fun, stimulating game, but a mind exercise that millions world-wide play to sharpen their intellect. Frank Longo, author of over 60 Sudoku books, provides the puzzles for SudokuPlus. These puzzles range from very simple beginner games to extremely difficult games. You will always be challenged. SudokuPlus has many helpful features and options not found in other Sudoku games. Special \"Beginner Mode\" settings make it easy for beginning players to learn Sudoku. Other settings remove the manual aspects of the game so players can focus on logic, not erasing notations. For all players, the SudokuPlus incremental solution engine can provide hints and clues at every step of puzzle solving. Custom games can be entered from external sources such as newspapers and books. Any game can be saved at any state of play to reopen and resume later. So you can enter a batch of games from one of your Sudoku books, save a game part way through and begin another, or just save a good puzzle to share with someone later. SudokuPlus can also make the puzzles more interesting or challenging by making the values letters, shapes, smiley faces, or familiar icons instead of numerals. Sierra Blanco Systems is dedicated to providing quality products and customer support. The demo is full functional, except it is limited in the number of included games, and the number of custom games that can be entered and saved. Be sure to visit www.SudokuForPre.com for more information, videos, etc. We are sure you will want the full version once you see what a value SudokuPlus is.",

To do this you must first slide the other blocks out of its way. This can be very tricky, but don't worry, the first puzzles are easy and will get you going quickly. Blocks remembers how far you have got, so you can pick it up and play at any time.\000a\000aThe blocks only slide along their oriented direction. So the horizontal blocks can only move left and right, while the vertical blocks slide up and down.\000a \000aThis free version contains one difficulty level with 25 puzzles. The full version has four levels, easy, medium, hard and expert, each containing 25 puzzles for a total of 100 puzzles.\000a\000aWe hope you have fun playing the game. We're keen to hear what you think of it, so don't hesitate to write us with feedback, questions, or bugs (although we hope there aren't any!).",

Too slow and the ball won’t make it all the way to the top of the ramp and it will roll back down. \000aThis is a midway classic game that is great if you just want to kill a couple of minutes.

You do this by tapping the particle diverters around the generator, or by pressing the keys W, A, S and Z which correspond to the top, left, right and bottom diverters respectively, to cycle through the diverter states.  Choose the right one to complete the circuit and thereby keeping a particle moving.  If a particle goes into the wrong port, or back into the generator, or hits a diverter with an incorrect state and cannot continue, you lose points.  Also, when they go back into the generator, or the wrong port, the engine heats up a little.  The bar below the play area fills up as the engine gets hotter.  Tap the game area somewhere other than the diverters, or press P, or physically shake your Pre, to cool the engine down a bit.  The game ends if the engine overheats.  It's a very challenging game that will take a great deal of concentration, planning ahead and quick reactions to avoid disaster!",

In addition to the 'bank' rate, you will see the rates that you will probably get when you use a credit card and money exchange counters, like at the airport.  Each time you start Exch-Calc it will access the internet and load up the latest exchange rates and seek out new currencies for you.  Then Exch-Calc stores those rates so that you do not need an active connection to perform your conversions.  If you're traveling where there isn't a signal, no problem, your stored rates will automatically be used to provide your calculation.  And you'll know how old those rates are because the latest date for each conversion rate is shown.  Perfect for when traveling where service is not available.",

Also corrected an issue with the lives.*** QuickWhack is a whack-a-mole style tap the button before the light goes out game. The \"moles\" show up for a good amount of time, but as the levels increase you find them popping in and out a lot quicker. If you miss a mole, you lose a life. You are able to change the options of what level to start on, and how fast the timer depletes. Be smart, be careful... be quick!",

"description": "Update: Web side manual generation added. Image size restriction added. Faster image loading - you will need to remove any scanned in cards and either generate them with the web generator, or scan them in again. Store your store cards and free your keys! WOG Card Keeper lets you put your shopper cards on your phone! Have heavy items in your cart? Put the barcode into the generator! Want to price check an item without carrying it around? Punch in the barcode and scan your phone! For most standard UPC (or EAN for the Europeans), you can simply put in the bar code numbers and it will be generated for you. For non standard shopper cards, you may upload a scanned image to the application through the Card Keeper website. No more digging around for your keys, or for a shopper card in your wallet or purse. These don't get dirty or rub off. Testing shows that the bar codes on the phones work best with hand scanners. Keep that in mind when you're checking out! Added better displaying of barcodes with a dark background and checking that the length is correct when cards are manually entered. Check the survey on the website to ensure your store works correctly. Re=enter any manually entered barcodes you have already entered.",

If it doesn't want to download images, it may require a reboot of the phone. ***\000a\000aSo... I am the type of guy that doesn't like things to stay static. One of the first things I did when I got my Pre was to set about figuring out a way to have the wallpaper changed automatically. Fun, eh?\000a* * * \000aWe made a solid little program that handles everything for you. You pick the type of wallpaper images you like and Switcharoo will go get super-snazzy, gorgeously optimized images for you from the server, downloaded once a day. Then it will automatically change your background wallpaper once a hour, once a day, once a week, whatever. You don't have to spend time hunting down quality wallpapers or setting your phone preferences, Switcharoo does it all.  Fairly soon, we are planning a version that will also let you pick from the images that exist on your phone.\000a* * * \000aThat's about it. You don't have to keep the Switcharoo card open. It does everything in the background automatically after you run it for the first time. But I have to say it is great fun to have my wallpaper changed just about every time I turn on my Pre, from thousands of great wallpapers that work on both the Pixi and the Pre. And my sister said it is just about her favorite app on the phone... and my sister wouldn't lie to you!",

Want to make sure you don't forget where you parked? Take a picture! Assign it a keyword of \"park\", and you'll easily locate it later.\000a\000aMemoryUpgrade is fast! Your memories are stored in a database for fast performance and reliability. With MemoryUpgrade, you can have thousands of memories and recall any one of them in a split second!\000a\000aWhat if you want to use the same keywords for more than one thing? Not a problem! You can use the same keywords for as many memories as you like, and when you type in the keywords later, all of the matching memories will be displayed in a list. Just select the memory from the list to view/edit it, or press the Copy icon to copy the data to the clipboard. \000a\000aWhat if you want to remember sensitive information, such as passwords? You can set the secret flag, which will mask the data in the results list with asterisks, yet you will still be able to copy the actual data to the clipboard by pressing the Copy icon. This allows you to use your sensitive data without worrying about that person looking over your shoulder.\000a\000aDo you already have some data in a text file or spreadsheet?

Depth of Field is a measure of how far in front or behind the focus point an object can be and still be in focus in an image. Depth of Field is determined by camera sensor size, lens focal length, lens aperture and subject distance. If the focus distance is set to the hyperfocal distance, the image will have the largest depth of field possible for that sensor, focal length and aperture. For example a landscape photographer may want to have the entire scene in focus, so they would choose to focus at the hyperfocal distance so that everything from the close foreground to the distant horizon would appear sharp in the final image. On the other hand a portrait photographer may want to use a very shallow depth of field so that distracting elements in the background will be blurred out of focus and not detract attention from the subject of the portrait.",

Someone who is proficient at this can think of the words they need using only these numbers.  We are putting you to the test!\000aT9 Cryptogram uses the same number and letter combinations that you’re so familiar with. Using these combinations we put up real quotes for you to decrypt. There are levels from easy to hard and more than 100 quotes from short to long, witty, funny, relevant and real for you to solve. This fast paced cryptogram game is not only fun but you also learn and retain these great quotes. \000aYou will see the quote on the screen using these numbers only and you have to figure it out using the letters just as if you were texting. Based on your level, you can check that you entered the right quote letter per letter or when you’re done with the entire quote. The quotes do not repeat and you can go through them in any order you want using simple WebOS gestures to flick through them.

"description": "\"Picasa On Phone\" app lets you access all public or private Google's Picasa web albums. The app has easy to use interface, you can flip, pan, and zoom the photos natively on the phone. You can watch photos in landscape or portrait mode and quickly scroll through the photos using the \"Scrollable Photo Index\" and jump to anywhere in the album, all staying on the same screen. The app will not use any of the on-phone storage to store photos.\000aBest part of this app is that you do not need to create any accounts anywhere. Just plug-in Google ID and start browsing through the photos. You can change the image resolution based on the bandwidth connection. By default the photo resolution is set to “LOW”.\000a\000aYou can view top 300 photos from Picasa’s featured album by clicking on the button.",

You don’t need to use paper notes anymore; these can be easily lost or thrown away by mistake. Instead use your WebOS device and carry your lists everywhere you go.  You can add as many items as you want and organize/filter them using stores and categories that you create.  Add your items to the Shopping Cart to view the total amount you will pay at the cashier and easily remove them from the active list once the purchase is completed.  The Shopping History will contain all items entered in the app so you can easily add them back to your active list.  If you cannot go to the store, use the Email Shopping List feature to send a list of items to a friend or family member to pick them up for you.",

The instructions and options will help you tailor the game to your liking.\000a\000aThis is a first for Palm's webOS (in my opinion).  We've all been waiting for a truly immersive sports game, and Soccer Shots delivers a game-winner!

The levels get harder, but your skills should increase through the 80 levels of play.  \000a\000aIn 40 levels of Beat-the-Timer you race the clock, trying to score a number of goals before the timer runs out.  The same goals are required in Beat-the-Goalie's 40 levels, except you have to score all of the goals before you are blocked more than 3 times!

You also have an option to save and load the current game so that you can pick up where you left off if you need to take a break.\000aIn Level mode you try to complete the required number of dropped pieces before the time runs out or there are no moves left to play. There are a total of 11 levels which each level getting harder. Each level has a different time length and number of different pieces. The amount of pieces cleared/required is in the upper left header. There is a pause feature in case you need to interrupt the current game.\000aIn Blitz mode you do the same as in Freeplay with one difference, the game only last one minute and the object is to score the highest possible score you can in that time frame.

"title": "Scatter",
"description": "Scatter is a simple game. Just tap the screen with your finger. That is the easy part. It is much harder to get the timing and placement of that tap to create a chain reaction which captures all the scattered balls. Each ball as a fixed amount of time it will remain on the screen after it has been hit. Then it will shrink away never to be seen again. To win, you have to complete all of the levels.\000aThere are two ways to play: Chaos and Puzzle modes. Chaos lets most everything run free and you need to capture most of the balls on the screen to complete each level. There are 3 sets of chaos modes with ten levels each. The puzzle mode is much more controlled and you will need to figure out just the right place and time to tap to recover the other balls. Basic puzzles contain only the balls moving around the screen. Wall puzzles use walls to complicate the puzzles by limiting the movement of the balls. Fuse delay puzzles include walls and allow some of the balls to keep moving after they are captured leaving a path of destruction in their wake.\000aEach level has a fixed score you will receive for completing the level. In addition for every ball you recover beyond the required number, you will get a bonus of 100 points. That is the good news. The bad news is that if you fail to complete the level, you will lose 100 points. Your final score comes from all of the level scores, bonus scores and failed attempts you make at each level.\000aThere are 23 puzzle levels and 30 chaos levels.",

"title": "Scatter Lite",
"description": "Scatter Lite is a free version of Scatter. Scatter is a simple game. Just tap the screen with your finger. That is the easy part. It is much harder to get the timing and placement of that tap to create a chain reaction which captures all the scattered balls. Each ball as a fixed amount of time it will remain on the screen after it has been hit. Then it will shrink away never to be seen again. To win, you have to complete all of the levels.\000aThere are two ways to play: Chaos and Puzzle modes. Chaos lets most everything run free and you need to capture most of the balls on the screen to complete each level. There are 3 sets of chaos modes with ten levels each in the full version. Scatter Lite has 8 levels. The puzzle mode is much more controlled and you will need to figure out just the right place and time to tap to recover the other balls. Basic puzzles contain only the balls moving around the screen. This is puzzles in Scatter Lite. The full version has wall puzzles which use walls to complicate the puzzles by limiting the movement of the balls. Fuse delay puzzles include walls and allow some of the balls to keep moving after they are captured leaving a path of destruction in their wake.\000aEach level has a fixed score you will receive for completing the level. In addition for every ball you recover beyond the required number, you will get a bonus of 100 points. That is the good news. The bad news is that if you fail to complete the level, you will lose 100 points. Your final score comes from all of the level scores, bonus scores and failed attempts you make at each level.\000aThere are 8 puzzle levels and 8 chaos levels.",

Fuel allows you to track as many vehicles as you have, in your preferred unit of measure (Miles/Kilometers, Gallons/Imperial Gallons/Litres). It will also help you when you're traveling by converting the values you see on the pump to the ones you are used to seeing, whether its distance, volume or currency (via Google Finance - Currency Converter). It'll even allow you to record your current location (via Location Services) and show you the nearby gas stations (via Google Maps). You can set up odometer/date based service reminders (i.e. oil change, tune-up, tire rotation, etc), and even create your own reminder presets. Fuel allows you to manage your data via import/export with a Google Docs account... so your data is accessible in the formats that you decide.",

"title": "T9 Cryptogram Lite",
"description": "The free limited Lite version of our popular T9 Cryptogram game! It has 15 famous quotes of various difficulty for you to try!\000aInvasive Bamboo presents a new twist of the classic Cryptogram word puzzle, the T9 Cryptogram! Many of us have grown up using the T9 method of entering text in our mobile phones.  Using the number pad, you can select from among 3 or 4 letters for each number.  Someone who is proficient at this can think of the words they need using only these numbers.  We are putting you to the test!\000aT9 Cryptogram uses the same number and letter combinations that you’re so familiar with. Using these combinations we put up real quotes for you to decrypt. There are levels from easy to hard and more than 100 quotes from short to long, witty, funny, relevant and real for you to solve. This fast paced cryptogram game is not only fun but you also learn and retain these great quotes. \000aYou will see the quote on the screen using these numbers only and you have to figure it out using the letters just as if you were texting. Based on your level, you can check that you entered the right quote letter per letter or when you’re done with the entire quote. The quotes do not repeat and you can go through them in any order you want using simple WebOS gestures to flick through them. Invasive Bamboo plans on updating the quotes so even if you think you got them all? There will be more waiting for you.  Keep up to date on our website.",

A NAC is a unified, highly efficient, language independent, unique and universal representation for both areas and locations anywhere in the world. It can be used as an address, postcode, area code, property identifier and geographic coordinates. Using a NAC instead of a street address to specify a location for location based services can save 80% of key input, avoid difficulties in inputting foreign characters, eliminate errors from outdated or duplicated or missing addresses, and extend the location based services to all locations no matter whether there are street addresses or not. As the coordinates of the Universal Map Grids, a NAC can also be directly pinpointed on all kinds of maps with the Universal Map Grids. As a Global Postal Code, it can make all mail sorted from the world level to final mail boxes automatically. Since an eight or ten character NAC can specify a location to the resolution of 30 meters and 1 meter respectively, it is also called a Universal Address. NACMaps can also function as a spatial watch to display your local Universal Address with the device internal GPS.",

"description": "In this high flying adventure, you will navigate a hot air balloon through a dangerous mountain range.  Holding the space bar (or holding your finger on the screen), you'll ignite the balloon's flame, and go higher and higher.  Be careful, though, since you only have limited fuel!  You can replenish fuel with (F) fuel elements along the way.  As the wind picks up, you won't be able to move up and down as quickly, so you'll have to time the balloon to pick up the elements you need.  Tilting the phone to one side or the other will move the balloon horizontally (sensitivity can be changed under options).  Read the instructions, check out the options, and enjoy the ride!  Please contact me at admin@shanerooni.com before leaving negative feedback so that I have a chance to make the game better and get your 4- or 5-star approval!  Thanks!",

"description": "The retro game you loved to play is now available on webOS.  Good for hours of diversionary fun.  How many can you catch?\000a\000aHISTORY:\000aHunt the Wumpus was introduced over 30 years ago in text-based format and was one of the earliest computer games.  Our version of this classic game of strategy and luck follows the original hide-and-seek formula as you track and sedate the mysterious Wumpus that lurks deep inside a network of caves.\000a\000aTHE GAME:\000aThe legendary Wumpus has been sighted around the nearby uncharted caverns.  As chief field worker of the local zoological society, you're given the job of catching this beast so that its ecological needs can be better understood.\000a\000aTo catch the elusive Wumpus, you must use your nose and your deductive powers to determine where the Wumpus is snoozing, without actually seeing it.  Equipped with a single tranquilizer dart (the Society runs on a tight budget), a lantern, some dynamite, and a canary, you must boldly overcome poisonous gas, giant bats, and sticky cave spider webs to find your quarry before it finds you.\000a\000aWhether you played Wumpus back in the day or are just hearing about this mythological creature, Wumpus is a fun diversion for all ages.",

Before you break it by tapping it, you can set the glow time from the menu in the top left. Be warned that the longer you set the glow time for, the more battery drain will occur. When glowing, the glowstick app will stop your phone from dimming.\000a\000aTap the glowstick to break it. It will begin glowing.\000a\000aShake your phone to make the glowstick begin glowing up. It will reach maximum glow in a couple seconds. The glowstick will continue to glow for the amount of time you have chosen (default is 1 minute).\000a\000aAfter time expires, the glowstick will gradually lose brightness.\000a\000aThrow away the glowstick (close the app) and you can do it all over again!\000a\000aDisclaimer: This app is not intended to be used as a safety device or a flashlight. It is solely a comical, fun application meant for amusement.

Starting times (durations) can be easily set using the Set Duration picker or by using 8 customizable Quick Durations. A default starting duration can be configured to have the countdown start as soon as the application is opened. Quickly modify the current duration by tapping the Increment/Decrement buttons which have customizable values, or flick using varying configurable velocities at the Hours, Minutes and Seconds values on the main screen, even as the countdown is running. As the countdown nears the end, a notification will display to alert you that the countdown is nearing zero. An optional audible tone and vibration occurs when zero is reached. The main countdown screen can be displayed using one of multiple themes. In addition to the main screen, a Dashboard will become available when the main screen is minimized or the device is locked. The Dashboard will show the remaining duration, starting duration and Start, Stop, Pause, Resume, Reset and Loop controls. All of the controls are fully functional from the lock screen.

"title": "Converter",
"description": "Converter, with over 20 types of conversions and 285 units is designed to be a quick and easy way to convert values having different units. On the opening page simply select what type of conversion you want to perform. This will bring you to the conversion page. Tap the unit list boxes to reveal a list of units for that particular conversion. You can enter values in both directions by toggling from \"Input Top\" and \"Input Bottom\" while using the virtual number pad. You may choose to ignore the \"Input Top\" and \"Input Bottom\" selection and enter values using the QWERTY keyboard directly into the text boxes if you desire however, you will probably find it easier to just use the virtual number pad. Tapping \"Copy\" will take the results and place it onto the Clipboard so one can paste the results into any other program. The program will remember the two units you select if you go back to the opening page before closing the program. If you choose to close the program directly from the conversion page, it will not save the two units. This way you can manage what units you want to save as your defaults for each conversion. All conversions are done with floating point math for accuracy; however, due to its limitations don't expect extreme conversions like \"Light Years to Microns\" to be extremely accurate. Results such as 2.9999999999 or 1.00000000001 can also be expected. I have chosen not to round these sorts of results since in very high or low numbers this can lead to greater inaccuracies.",

You must find the atoms hidden inside the black box using laser rays. It is simply too dangerous to peer in yourself and in any case it is too small to see the atoms. The locations of the atoms can be deduced by seeing the outcome of the rays. \000a\000aBlack Box is a simply puzzle game you can play while in a meeting (not that we advocate that mind you), waiting in the airport or any other place where you need a mindless distraction. It is simple but at the higher levels the strategy can be deep and take some time. \000a\000aWe hope you enjoy taking a look at this timeless classic from the beginning of gaming on the modern WebOS platform.",

Tap Flick Slide offers 2 skill levels, 3 different background music choices, and choose from 1-4 players to go head-to-head with your friends.  What will be your high score…?  Warning: Highly Addictive, we are not responsible for lost jobs or other problems caused by excessive playing of Tap Flick Slide.  Try out the free Lite version before you buy!  Note: We are excited to have come up with a unique solution to provide actual sound effects (most games don’t have any), we do know they could be louder; unfortunately (for now) we are limited by factors in Palm webOS.  Don’t worry we plan on making big-time updates to the sound effects (including voice commands) as Palm updates how they handle audio in games (hopefully very soon)!",

When you solve the puzzle, your name, time and number of moves to complete are recorded.

"description": "Mexia, a.k.a the \"Mexican Messiah\", a Latin hip-hop artist spittin nimble rhymes in Spanish, English, and Spanglish over electro-tinged beats. Mexia, the cipher tested skateboard kid from San Jose California's predominantly chicano East Side who cut his teeth in MC battles. Also, Mexia (government named Hernan Hernandez Jr.) who grew up watching his father and uncles perform in norteno's Grammy-stacking version of the Rolling Stones, Los Tigres Del Norte. Now the past and present is meshing for an exciting future as the younger Hernandez emerges from behind his father's enormous shadow. It would haven been easy for Mexia to carry on the family tradition, singing beloved corridos. Yet, each generation discovers its own voice and vessel and for Mexia, that was hip-hop. He was an avid break-dancer, MC, and graffiti writer. He and his cousin, a DJ, would obsess over the latest 12\" singles from EPMD or A Tribe Called Quest. Curiosity taking over, a 15 year old Mexia would goof off around in the Tigres' rehearsal studio, making drum loops, and spittin rhymes. Soon, Mexia was hooking up with like-minded MCs and DJs, slanging CDs outside of malls, sneaking into clubs, and jumping into freestyle ciphers. His latest hit single \"Descontrol\" is an up-tempo, wildin' out cuts that make club security and high school principals nervous with its demand to \"muevelolo\", with an emphasis on the latter \"lo\". Produced by acclaimed studio technicians the Iklectix, \"Descontrol\" is a rowdy club banger that bridges Latin pop, hip-hop, and electro that will bring a sweat to your brow and a sway to your hips. Mexia is combining the contemporary and traditional worlds to form his own unique galaxy in Latin hip-hop.",

You can change the width, opacity, and color of the line.  As an added bonus—you can even draw with a completely transparent line, which certainly takes care of that problem of how to get from one side of the drawing to the other!  Your doodles are saved, so you can continue working on your masterpiece later.   To erase, simply shake your device or turn it over.       \000aThis version of roll-a-doodle is ad-supported.  Upgrade to roll-a-doodle plus (not available in all areas) to get rid of the ads, save more doodles, and change the background color.  \000a       Feedback via the reviews or email is always appreciated!",

"title": "roll-a-doodle plus",
"description": "Remember the toy you had when you were a kid that let you sketch out crude drawings by turning the two knobs?  We designed roll-a-doodle with that experience in mind, but updated it for your webOS device.  Tilt your phone to roll a ball around the screen, drawing as it goes.  You can change the width, opacity, and color of the line.  As an added bonus—you can even draw with a completely transparent line, which certainly takes care of that problem of how to get from one side of the drawing to the other!  Your doodles are saved, so you can continue working on your masterpiece later.   To erase, simply shake your device or turn it over.      If you want to try before you buy, look for the base version of roll-a-doodle which is ad-supported, can only save two doodles, and doesn’t allow you to change the background or hide the ball.   Feedback via the reviews or email is always appreciated!",
