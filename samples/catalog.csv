"Blocks","Blocks is a classic and addictive puzzle game. The goal of the game is to slide the light-colored block off the board. To do this you must first slide the other blocks out of its way. This can be very tricky, but don't worry, the first puzzles are easy and will get you going quickly. Blocks remembers how far you have got, so you can pick it up and play at any time.

The blocks only slide along their oriented direction. So the horizontal blocks can only move left and right, while the vertical blocks slide up and down.
 
Once you complete all the puzzles in a difficulty level, the next level will be unlocked. There are four levels, easy, medium, hard and expert, each containing 25 puzzles for a total of 100 puzzles. You might fly through the first puzzles, but you'll be sweating over the later ones!

The tax rate can be entered up to three decimal places (7.125% for example) to account for all taxable municipalities and the amount is entered by you instead of having to choose from pre-defined values that might not work for your area.  To save you time, the percentage to tip is selected by sliding your finger to quickly adjust the desired tip percentage, with all amounts being updated and displayed as you are making your adjustments.  You can choose to round the total or keep it to an exact amount and you can split the check with up to 10 people.  Your settings are saved so that subsequent uses only require you to enter a new check amount and adjust your tip percentage based on the quality of service.","2009-10-23 17:10:23","57.735","com.calql8tips","1.0.2","439164","4.2","13077","20","http://cdn.downloads.palm.com/public/57/icon/L/icon.png","0","ERROR!"

"DOF Calculator","* This update provides more sensor size choices and will also allow you to select DSLR cameras by name or directly select the Circle of Confusion that is used in the DOF calculation.*


A depth of field calculator can help photographers to figure out how much of their picture will be in focus.  Depth of Field is a measure of how far in front or behind the focus point an object can be and still be in focus in an image. Depth of Field is determined by camera sensor size, lens focal length, lens aperture and subject distance. If the focus distance is set to the hyperfocal distance, the image will have the largest depth of field possible for that sensor, focal length and aperture.  For example a landscape photographer may want to have the entire scene in focus, so they would choose to focus at the hyperfocal distance so that everything from the close foreground to the distant horizon would appear sharp in the final image.  On the other hand a portrait photographer may want to use a very shallow depth of field so that distracting elements in the background will be blurred out of focus and not detract attention from the subject of the portrait.","2009-10-29 05:17:29","453.745","org.thegunns.dofcalc","0.9.3","164864","4","360","5","http://cdn.downloads.palm.com/public/453/icon/L/icon.png","1.9900000095367","Photography!Tools"

The Freeplay has 13 different high pitch sounds (frequently called ""mosquito tones"" or ""mosquito ringtones"") that can be used to annoy almost anyone.  The Hearing Test will guide you through a wizard and give you your results of how high you can hear.  These high pitch sounds are often used by teenagers as cell phone ringtones because teachers and other adults cannot hear them.

**NOTE: Palm does not currently allow setting the tones as your ringtone from the app. They are available for download from the support website for now and can be added as your ringtone manually. Adding them as ringtones will hopefully come in a later update.**","2009-10-29 05:08:29","415.847","com.brycelund.mosquitones","1.0.0","5144908","3.6","2728","41","http://cdn.downloads.palm.com/public/415/icon/L/icon.png","0.99000000953674","Entertainment!Animals"
"Pegger Meister","Pegger Meister is an addictive game perfect for anyone with a little time to burn while waiting for a meeting, a dental appointment, at the bus stop or subway terminal or at work when the boss is away.  The object of the game is to move the peg over an adjacent peg in order to remove it.  In order to jump over a peg, the hole on the other side must be vacant.  If you do it right and learn all the tricks with experience, you can win when only one peg is left on the board.

The way to win is to first get rid of all the pegs in the corners.  By leaving most of the pegs clumped together in the center until the end, you will probably have a greater chance of winning.  The lower the score is at the end, the better.  Low scorers are recorded in the records list.

There are several levels of difficulty which can be chosen from the preferences menu.  

For those of you who are interested in history, the game was most probably invented in France in the late 17th century.  

Now start playing the game before the boss returns!","2009-10-29 05:26:29","483.849","com.avnerarbel.peggermeister","1.0.0","693716","3.3","186","2","http://cdn.downloads.palm.com/public/483/icon/L/default64x64.png","0.99000000953674","Games!Classics"

"Roller Ball","Easy to learn hard to master, the classic boardwalk game of skee-ball comes to the Pre. Aim and swing by making an underhand pitching motion to start the ball rolling up the ramp.  If you are in a tight spot you can flick the ball toward the holes. Different speed swings will let you get to all the high point holes. Too slow and the ball won’t make it all the way to the top of the ramp and it will roll back down. 
This is a midway classic game that is great if you just want to kill a couple of minutes. When the bonus hole lights up, shoot for it and you can get extra balls. The game has two different boards so you can try your luck on each.","2009-11-24 19:01:18","531.1204","com.caldantechpub.rollerball","1.0.13","1474629","2.1","1171","20","http://cdn.downloads.palm.com/public/531/icon/L/icon.png","0.99000000953674","Games!Classics"

"Engineer","Engineer is a free application from the upcoming book ""Practical webOS Projects with the Palm Pre"".  It is a game where you play the part of engineer of the starship Prenterprise (hehe).  Your job is to direct particles created by the generator in the center of the screen into the correct injector port at the corners based on color.  You do this by tapping the particle diverters around the generator, or by pressing the keys W, A, S and Z which correspond to the top, left, right and bottom diverters respectively, to cycle through the diverter states.  Choose the right one to complete the circuit and thereby keeping a particle moving.  If a particle goes into the wrong port, or back into the generator, or hits a diverter with an incorrect state and cannot continue, you lose points.  Also, when they go back into the generator, or the wrong port, the engine heats up a little.  The bar below the play area fills up as the engine gets hotter.  Tap the game area somewhere other than the diverters, or press P, or physically shake your Pre, to cool the engine down a bit.  The game ends if the engine overheats.  It's a very challenging game that will take a great deal of concentration, planning ahead and quick reactions to avoid disaster!","2009-12-09 03:58:29","505.1336","com.etherient.engineer","1.0.2","449336","3","13072","38","http://cdn.downloads.palm.com/public/505/icon/L/engineer_64x64.png","0","Games!Brain Teasers"

"Wallpaper Switcharoo","*** information: sometimes switcharoo gets stuck. Usually just starting switcharoo will kick start everything. If it doesn't want to download images, it may require a reboot of the phone. ***

So... I am the type of guy that doesn't like things to stay static. One of the first things I did when I got my Pre was to set about figuring out a way to have the wallpaper changed automatically. Fun, eh?
* * * 
We made a solid little program that handles everything for you. You pick the type of wallpaper images you like and Switcharoo will go get super-snazzy, gorgeously optimized images for you from the server, downloaded once a day. Then it will automatically change your background wallpaper once a hour, once a day, once a week, whatever. You don't have to spend time hunting down quality wallpapers or setting your phone preferences, Switcharoo does it all.  Fairly soon, we are planning a version that will also let you pick from the images that exist on your phone.
* * * 
That's about it. You don't have to keep the Switcharoo card open. It does everything in the background automatically after you run it for the first time. But I have to say it is great fun to have my wallpaper changed just about every time I turn on my Pre, from thousands of great wallpapers that work on both the Pixi and the Pre. And my sister said it is just about her favorite app on the phone... and my sister wouldn't lie to you!","2009-12-03 00:32:09","567.1548","com.orbsix.app.switcharoo","0.9.23","427549","4.5","2979","126","http://cdn.downloads.palm.com/public/567/icon/L/icon.png","1.9900000095367","Productivity & Utilities!Tools"

MemoryUpgrade is fast! Your memories are stored in a database for fast performance and reliability. With MemoryUpgrade, you can have thousands of memories and recall any one of them in a split second!

What if you want to use the same keywords for more than one thing? Not a problem! You can use the same keywords for as many memories as you like, and when you type in the keywords later, all of the matching memories will be displayed in a list. Just select the memory from the list to view/edit it, or press the Copy icon to copy the data to the clipboard. 

What if you want to remember sensitive information, such as passwords? You can set the secret flag, which will mask the data in the results list with asterisks, yet you will still be able to copy the actual data to the clipboard by pressing the Copy icon. This allows you to use your sensitive data without worrying about that person looking over your shoulder.

"DOF Calculator Trial","* This is a fully functional 7 day trial of DOF Calculator *
* This update provides more sensor size choices and will also allow you to select DSLR cameras by name or directly select the Circle of Confusion that is used in the DOF calculation.* A depth of field calculator can help photographers to figure out how much of their picture will be in focus. Depth of Field is a measure of how far in front or behind the focus point an object can be and still be in focus in an image. Depth of Field is determined by camera sensor size, lens focal length, lens aperture and subject distance. If the focus distance is set to the hyperfocal distance, the image will have the largest depth of field possible for that sensor, focal length and aperture. For example a landscape photographer may want to have the entire scene in focus, so they would choose to focus at the hyperfocal distance so that everything from the close foreground to the distant horizon would appear sharp in the final image. On the other hand a portrait photographer may want to use a very shallow depth of field so that distracting elements in the background will be blurred out of focus and not detract attention from the subject of the portrait.","2009-12-03 19:46:17","760.1691","org.thegunns.dofcalctrial","1.0.0","412177","2.5","1372","4","http://cdn.downloads.palm.com/public/760/icon/L/icon.png","0","Photography!Tools"

Invasive Bamboo presents a new twist of the classic Cryptogram word puzzle, the T9 Cryptogram! Many of us have grown up using the T9 method of entering text in our mobile phones.  Using the number pad, you can select from among 3 or 4 letters for each number.  Someone who is proficient at this can think of the words they need using only these numbers.  We are putting you to the test!
T9 Cryptogram uses the same number and letter combinations that you’re so familiar with. Using these combinations we put up real quotes for you to decrypt. There are levels from easy to hard and more than 100 quotes from short to long, witty, funny, relevant and real for you to solve. This fast paced cryptogram game is not only fun but you also learn and retain these great quotes. 
You will see the quote on the screen using these numbers only and you have to figure it out using the letters just as if you were texting. Based on your level, you can check that you entered the right quote letter per letter or when you’re done with the entire quote. The quotes do not repeat and you can go through them in any order you want using simple WebOS gestures to flick through them. Invasive Bamboo plans on updating the quotes so even if you think you got them all? There will be more waiting for you.

"Soccer Shots","***I have dropped the price to be more in-line with the market.  Although upgrades are still in the works, I'd like for more people to enjoy this app as it is currently.  Thanks for the support!*** Please read the instructions once you download the game.  The instructions and options will help you tailor the game to your liking.

This is a first for Palm's webOS (in my opinion).  We've all been waiting for a truly immersive sports game, and Soccer Shots delivers a game-winner!  You will take on the clock or the goalie - your choice - in order to try and amass the best shot percentage and time left/blocks stats!  The levels get harder, but your skills should increase through the 80 levels of play.  

In 40 levels of Beat-the-Timer you race the clock, trying to score a number of goals before the timer runs out.  The same goals are required in Beat-the-Goalie's 40 levels, except you have to score all of the goals before you are blocked more than 3 times!  Try your best to beat your biggest competitor - yourself!

Your feedback is appreciated in order to grow this into a world class game!","2009-12-04 00:42:31","810.1799","com.shanerooni.soccershots","0.9.5","1031295","3.4","255","9","http://cdn.downloads.palm.com/public/810/icon/L/soccer_3_64.png","1.9900000095367","Games!Sports"

"loanCruncher","Buying a house?  You need loanCruncher!  More than just a loan calculator, loanCruncher helps you estimate your full monthly mortgage payment, factoring in things like PMI, closing costs, taxes, etc.    Enter down payment and closing costs in percentage or dollars.  Enter your expected taxes, insurance, and association costs per year, month, half, quarter, or percent of purchase price. loanCruncher then figures out your total monthly cost.  Have a budget and not sure how much house you can get for that amount?  Enter your available cash, budgeted monthly payment, and estimates for the other costs and loanCruncher will figure out a maximum purchase price that would fit your budget.  

As you work, loanCruncher automatically updates your result.  If you close loanCruncher, everything you’ve done is restored when you open it again.

You can save up to 5 scenarios and compare them on screen or even email them to yourself.  Thinking about refinancing? Enter your current mortgage information in one scenario, and your proposed refinanced mortgage in another to compare them.  Need an estimate of your payoff amount? Enter your mortgage information, and you can do a payoff calculation, including factoring in your extra regular principal payments.  

PMI rates are entered on the preferences screen and can include upfront PMI, monthly PMI, or both.  When your down payment is less than 20%, loanCruncher will automatically apply the PMI rates entered.  And if you just want a simple loan calculation, loanCruncher can do that too, just select “simple loan” instead of “mortgage estimator” in the preferences.","2009-12-07 23:31:41","847.1865","com.mikagika.loancruncher","1.0.00","679753","3.3","74","3","http://cdn.downloads.palm.com/public/847/icon/L/loancruncher64.png","1.9700000286102","Finance!Personal"

"Scatter","Scatter is a simple game. Just tap the screen with your finger. That is the easy part. It is much harder to get the timing and placement of that tap to create a chain reaction which captures all the scattered balls. Each ball as a fixed amount of time it will remain on the screen after it has been hit. Then it will shrink away never to be seen again. To win, you have to complete all of the levels.
There are two ways to play: Chaos and Puzzle modes. Chaos lets most everything run free and you need to capture most of the balls on the screen to complete each level. There are 3 sets of chaos modes with ten levels each. The puzzle mode is much more controlled and you will need to figure out just the right place and time to tap to recover the other balls. Basic puzzles contain only the balls moving around the screen. Wall puzzles use walls to complicate the puzzles by limiting the movement of the balls. Fuse delay puzzles include walls and allow some of the balls to keep moving after they are captured leaving a path of destruction in their wake.
Each level has a fixed score you will receive for completing the level. In addition for every ball you recover beyond the required number, you will get a bonus of 100 points. That is the good news. The bad news is that if you fail to complete the level, you will lose 100 points. Your final score comes from all of the level scores, bonus scores and failed attempts you make at each level.
There are 23 puzzle levels and 30 chaos levels.","2009-12-04 23:05:40","819.1868","com.caldantechpub.scatter","0.8.67","2003486","4.4","451","16","http://cdn.downloads.palm.com/public/819/icon/L/icon.png","0.99000000953674","Games!Arcade"

Invasive Bamboo presents a new twist of the classic Cryptogram word puzzle, the T9 Cryptogram! Many of us have grown up using the T9 method of entering text in our mobile phones.  Using the number pad, you can select from among 3 or 4 letters for each number.  Someone who is proficient at this can think of the words they need using only these numbers.  We are putting you to the test!
T9 Cryptogram uses the same number and letter combinations that you’re so familiar with. Using these combinations we put up real quotes for you to decrypt. There are levels from easy to hard and more than 100 quotes from short to long, witty, funny, relevant and real for you to solve. This fast paced cryptogram game is not only fun but you also learn and retain these great quotes. 
You will see the quote on the screen using these numbers only and you have to figure it out using the letters just as if you were texting. Based on your level, you can check that you entered the right quote letter per letter or when you’re done with the entire quote. The quotes do not repeat and you can go through them in any order you want using simple WebOS gestures to flick through them. Invasive Bamboo plans on updating the quotes so even if you think you got them all? There will be more waiting for you.

"NACMaps","NACMaps is a NAC enhancement for Google Maps to let users able to specify all areas and locations in the world with Natural Area Codes (NACs) (http://www.nacgeo.com/nacsite/) for satellite and street maps, local business/attraction searches or turn-by-turn driving/transit/walking directions. A NAC is a unified, highly efficient, language independent, unique and universal representation for both areas and locations anywhere in the world. It can be used as an address, postcode, area code, property identifier and geographic coordinates. Using a NAC instead of a street address to specify a location for location based services can save 80% of key input, avoid difficulties in inputting foreign characters, eliminate errors from outdated or duplicated or missing addresses, and extend the location based services to all locations no matter whether there are street addresses or not. As the coordinates of the Universal Map Grids, a NAC can also be directly pinpointed on all kinds of maps with the Universal Map Grids. As a Global Postal Code, it can make all mail sorted from the world level to final mail boxes automatically. Since an eight or ten character NAC can specify a location to the resolution of 30 meters and 1 meter respectively, it is also called a Universal Address. NACMaps can also function as a spatial watch to display your local Universal Address with the device internal GPS.","2009-12-24 02:21:34","905.1974","com.nacgeo.nacmaps","1.0.0","511446","0","14","0","http://cdn.downloads.palm.com/public/905/icon/L/nacmapsiconmedium.png","9.9899997711182","Navigation!Driving"

You can replenish fuel with (F) fuel elements along the way.  As the wind picks up, you won't be able to move up and down as quickly, so you'll have to time the balloon to pick up the elements you need.  Tilting the phone to one side or the other will move the balloon horizontally (sensitivity can be changed under options).  Read the instructions, check out the options, and enjoy the ride!

"Wumpus","The retro game you loved to play is now available on webOS.  Good for hours of diversionary fun.  How many can you catch?

HISTORY:
Hunt the Wumpus was introduced over 30 years ago in text-based format and was one of the earliest computer games.  Our version of this classic game of strategy and luck follows the original hide-and-seek formula as you track and sedate the mysterious Wumpus that lurks deep inside a network of caves.

THE GAME:
The legendary Wumpus has been sighted around the nearby uncharted caverns.  As chief field worker of the local zoological society, you're given the job of catching this beast so that its ecological needs can be better understood.

To catch the elusive Wumpus, you must use your nose and your deductive powers to determine where the Wumpus is snoozing, without actually seeing it.  Equipped with a single tranquilizer dart (the Society runs on a tight budget), a lantern, some dynamite, and a canary, you must boldly overcome poisonous gas, giant bats, and sticky cave spider webs to find your quarry before it finds you.

Whether you played Wumpus back in the day or are just hearing about this mythological creature, Wumpus is a fun diversion for all ages.","2009-12-16 00:51:04","927.2173","com.inspiringapps.wumpus","1.0.1","2201974","4.3","241","7","http://cdn.downloads.palm.com/public/927/icon/L/icon.png","1.9900000095367","Games!Classics"

Simply set the detector name and give the device a slight tilt for the needle to start moving.  Tilt the device even more to get a higher reading and peg the meter.  Realistic sounds, needle movement and LED make this meter even better.

Give the meter a funny name like:

"WOG Glowstick","WOG Glowstick is a very simple application. Read what it does - it is very simple and straightforward. 

It is just meant for fun and will eventually have more colored glowsticks to choose from.

When you open the app, you will have an empty glowstick. Before you break it by tapping it, you can set the glow time from the menu in the top left. Be warned that the longer you set the glow time for, the more battery drain will occur. When glowing, the glowstick app will stop your phone from dimming.

Tap the glowstick to break it. It will begin glowing.

Shake your phone to make the glowstick begin glowing up. It will reach maximum glow in a couple seconds. The glowstick will continue to glow for the amount of time you have chosen (default is 1 minute).

After time expires, the glowstick will gradually lose brightness.

Throw away the glowstick (close the app) and you can do it all over again!

Disclaimer: This app is not intended to be used as a safety device or a flashlight. It is solely a comical, fun application meant for amusement. Shaking your phone with slippery hands may not be a good idea, and WOG bears no responsibility if you accidentally (or purposefully) throw your phone violently and break it.","2009-12-17 03:02:05","1116.2302","com.wog.glowstick","1.0.1","2033682","4","170","4","http://cdn.downloads.palm.com/public/1116/icon/L/icon.png","0.99000000953674","Entertainment!Family"

"Converter","Converter, with over 20 types of conversions and 285 units is designed to be a quick and easy way to convert values having different units. On the opening page simply select what type of conversion you want to perform. This will bring you to the conversion page. Tap the unit list boxes to reveal a list of units for that particular conversion. You can enter values in both directions by toggling from ""Input Top"" and ""Input Bottom"" while using the virtual number pad. You may choose to ignore the ""Input Top"" and ""Input Bottom"" selection and enter values using the QWERTY keyboard directly into the text boxes if you desire however, you will probably find it easier to just use the virtual number pad. Tapping ""Copy"" will take the results and place it onto the Clipboard so one can paste the results into any other program. The program will remember the two units you select if you go back to the opening page before closing the program. If you choose to close the program directly from the conversion page, it will not save the two units. This way you can manage what units you want to save as your defaults for each conversion. All conversions are done with floating point math for accuracy; however, due to its limitations don't expect extreme conversions like ""Light Years to Microns"" to be extremely accurate. Results such as 2.9999999999 or 1.00000000001 can also be expected. I have chosen not to round these sorts of results since in very high or low numbers this can lead to greater inaccuracies.","2009-12-19 00:08:23","1277.2449","com.defranco.converter","1.0.3","579528","4.9","208","6","http://cdn.downloads.palm.com/public/1277/icon/L/icon.png","1.5","Productivity & Utilities!Tools"

In Black Box you have control of a radioactive black box that you are running experiments on. You must find the atoms hidden inside the black box using laser rays. It is simply too dangerous to peer in yourself and in any case it is too small to see the atoms. The locations of the atoms can be deduced by seeing the outcome of the rays. 

Black Box is a simply puzzle game you can play while in a meeting (not that we advocate that mind you), waiting in the airport or any other place where you need a mindless distraction. It is simple but at the higher levels the strategy can be deep and take some time. 

We hope you enjoy taking a look at this timeless classic from the beginning of gaming on the modern WebOS platform.","2009-12-16 21:50:41","1357.2538","com.invasivebamboo.blackbox","1.0.0","521091","4","92","5","http://cdn.downloads.palm.com/public/1357/icon/L/icon.png","0.99000000953674","Games!Classics"

"Mexia","Mexia, a.k.a the ""Mexican Messiah"", a Latin hip-hop artist spittin nimble rhymes in Spanish, English, and Spanglish over electro-tinged beats. Mexia, the cipher tested skateboard kid from San Jose California's predominantly chicano East Side who cut his teeth in MC battles. Also, Mexia (government named Hernan Hernandez Jr.) who grew up watching his father and uncles perform in norteno's Grammy-stacking version of the Rolling Stones, Los Tigres Del Norte. Now the past and present is meshing for an exciting future as the younger Hernandez emerges from behind his father's enormous shadow. It would haven been easy for Mexia to carry on the family tradition, singing beloved corridos. Yet, each generation discovers its own voice and vessel and for Mexia, that was hip-hop. He was an avid break-dancer, MC, and graffiti writer. He and his cousin, a DJ, would obsess over the latest 12"" singles from EPMD or A Tribe Called Quest. Curiosity taking over, a 15 year old Mexia would goof off around in the Tigres' rehearsal studio, making drum loops, and spittin rhymes. Soon, Mexia was hooking up with like-minded MCs and DJs, slanging CDs outside of malls, sneaking into clubs, and jumping into freestyle ciphers. His latest hit single ""Descontrol"" is an up-tempo, wildin' out cuts that make club security and high school principals nervous with its demand to ""muevelolo"", with an emphasis on the latter ""lo"". Produced by acclaimed studio technicians the Iklectix, ""Descontrol"" is a rowdy club banger that bridges Latin pop, hip-hop, and electro that will bring a sweat to your brow and a sway to your hips. Mexia is combining the contemporary and traditional worlds to form his own unique galaxy in Latin hip-hop.","2009-12-25 09:24:45","1728.3013","com.dijit.mexia","2.0.4","2748221","0","3","0","http://cdn.downloads.palm.com/public/1728/icon/L/icon.png","0.99000000953674","Music!Artists"
